# Tier 3 — Speculative Frontier Ideas

These 5 algorithms push creative boundaries. Each paper is explicit about
what is proven versus conjectured, and identifies the assumptions that would
need to hold for the approach to work.

| Paper | Algorithm | Speculation Level | Key Assumption |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| 11 | Turing Morphogenesis | High | Satellites ≈ continuous morphogens on sphere |
| 12 | Helmholtz Free Energy | Medium | Temperature ↔ risk tolerance mapping is meaningful |
| 13 | Nash Equilibrium Avoidance | Medium | Operators behave as rational game players |
| 14 | Melnikov Separatrix Surfing | High | J2 perturbation is small enough for Melnikov analysis |
| 15 | Spectral Gap Coverage | Medium | Coverage Laplacian construction is well-defined |

These are ideas worth exploring, not claims of solved problems. The papers
document the creative leap and assess feasibility honestly.
