# Tier 2 — Conceptual, Mathematically Grounded

These 5 algorithms are mathematically specified and validated conceptually,
but not yet implemented. Each paper identifies the existing Humeris modules
that would be composed, the new implementation required, and the validation
approach.

| Paper | Algorithm | Complexity | Prerequisites |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| 06 | Network SIR Cascade | Medium | cascade_analysis + graph_analysis |
| 07 | Hamiltonian Fisher-Rao Covariance | High | numerical_propagation + orbit_determination |
| 08 | Surface Code Coverage Protection | High | coverage analysis + topology |
| 09 | Percolation-Debris Coupled Phase | Medium | cascade_analysis + graph_analysis + kessler_heatmap |
| 10 | Bayesian Intent Joint Estimation | High | maneuver_detection + orbit_determination |

These algorithms are grounded in established mathematics (percolation theory,
symplectic geometry, topological quantum codes, Bayesian inference) applied
to novel orbital mechanics contexts.
