## 3. Free use (non-commercial)

You may use, copy, and modify the covered files **at no cost** for:

- Personal projects
- Academic research and education
- Evaluation, testing, and prototyping
- Open-source projects that do not generate revenue
- Any other non-commercial purpose

**Clarification — academic use**: Use at a publicly funded academic institution
for research purposes is non-commercial, regardless of funding source (grants,
government funding, industry-sponsored research collaborations).

**Clarification — evaluation**: You may evaluate the Software for up to 90 days
at a for-profit entity to determine whether to purchase a commercial license.
During evaluation, the Software may not be used in production, for revenue-
generating activities, or to provide services to third parties.

## 4. Commercial use

Commercial use means using the Software in connection with any activity that
generates or is intended to generate revenue, directly or indirectly. This
includes, but is not limited to:

- Incorporating the Software into a product or service offered for a fee
- Using the Software to provide paid consulting, analysis, or engineering
  services to third parties
- Using the Software as an internal tool at a for-profit entity (beyond the
  90-day evaluation period in Section 3)
- Offering the Software (or a derivative) as a hosted service (SaaS)

**Consumer exception**: If you are a natural person acting outside your trade,
business, or profession, you may use the Software free of charge under Section 3.

## 5. License grant

Subject to the terms of this agreement and payment of the applicable license
fee, the Licensor grants the Licensee a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
non-transferable** (except as provided in Section 12) license to:

- **Use** the Software for the Licensee's own commercial purposes
- **Copy** the Software for internal use, backup, and disaster recovery
- **Modify** the Software and create derivative works for the Licensee's
  own commercial purposes
- **Deploy** the Software as part of the Licensee's products, services, or
  internal infrastructure, including SaaS offerings

The license does **not** include the right to:

- **Redistribute** the Software (in source or binary form) as a standalone
  product or library
- **Sublicense** the Software to third parties
- **Offer** the Software itself (as opposed to a product built with it) as a
  service

Contractors, consultants, and agents of the Licensee may use the Software on
behalf of the Licensee under this license, provided such use is exclusively for
the Licensee's benefit and the Licensee remains responsible for compliance.

## 6. Pricing

| Tier | Eligibility | One-time license fee |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Startup** | < 50 employees AND ≤ EUR 10M annual revenue | **EUR 2,000** |
| **Enterprise** | ≥ 50 employees OR > EUR 10M annual revenue | **EUR 7,500** |
| **Government & Defense** | Government agencies, military, or entities where > 50% of annual revenue derives from government or defense contracts | **EUR 15,000** |

Employee count and revenue are measured at the purchasing legal entity and its
majority-owned affiliates (> 50% ownership), based on the most recent audited
financial statements or annual accounts at the time of purchase.

The applicable tier is **locked at the date of purchase**. If the Licensee later
grows beyond the original tier's eligibility criteria, the existing license
remains valid and the Licensee is not required to pay the difference. Future
purchases of additional modules are priced at the then-applicable tier.

## 7. Optional: Support & Updates subscription

**EUR 1,500/year** (all tiers). Includes:

- Priority bug fixes
- Access to new commercial modules released during the subscription period
- Direct communication channel for bug reports and technical questions

The subscription requires a prior commercial license purchase. Modules received
during an active subscription period are **perpetually licensed** under the same
terms as the original purchase. If the subscription lapses, the Licensee retains
full use rights to all modules received while the subscription was active but
does not receive modules released after lapse.

The subscription is optional. The perpetual license stands on its own.

## 8. Warranty disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTY
THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR FIT FOR ANY PARTICULAR
APPLICATION INCLUDING SAFETY-CRITICAL OR MISSION-CRITICAL SYSTEMS.

THE LICENSEE IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE SUITABILITY OF THE
SOFTWARE FOR ITS INTENDED USE AND FOR ANY RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE SOFTWARE.

## 9. Limitation of liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
PROFITS, DATA, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, OR GOODWILL, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF
ACTION OR THE THEORY OF LIABILITY.

THE LICENSOR'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE LICENSE FEE ACTUALLY PAID BY THE LICENSEE.

Nothing in this agreement excludes or limits liability for intent (*opzet*) or
gross negligence (*bewuste roekeloosheid*) to the extent such exclusion is
prohibited under Dutch law.

## 10. Termination

This license terminates automatically if the Licensee materially breaches any
term of this agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days of written
notice from the Licensor.

Upon termination, the Licensee must cease all commercial use of the covered
files and destroy all copies. Sections 8 (Warranty disclaimer), 9 (Limitation
of liability), 11 (Governing law), and 14 (Export control) survive termination.

Termination does not affect the Licensee's right to use the MIT-licensed
portions of the project under the MIT License.

## 11. Governing law and jurisdiction

This agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
Netherlands.

Any dispute arising from or in connection with this agreement shall be submitted
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court in The Hague
(*Rechtbank Den Haag*), the Netherlands.

## 12. Assignment and transfer

**Licensor**: The copyright and licensing authority may be assigned to a
successor entity (such as a company founded by the copyright holder). Any such
assignment will be communicated to existing licensees. License terms remain
unchanged.

**Licensee**: The Licensee may not assign or transfer this license without prior
written consent of the Licensor, except in connection with a merger,
acquisition, or sale of substantially all of the Licensee's assets, provided
the successor entity (a) agrees to be bound by the terms of this agreement and
(b) meets the eligibility criteria for the applicable tier or pays the
difference.

## 13. Verification

The Licensor may request reasonable evidence of tier eligibility (such as annual
accounts or a statement of employee count). The Licensee shall respond within
30 days. Failure to respond constitutes a material breach under Section 10.

## 14. Export control and sanctions

The Licensee represents and warrants that:

- It is not subject to sanctions or export restrictions imposed by the European
  Union, the Netherlands, or the United Nations.
- It shall not re-export or transfer the Software in violation of applicable
  export control laws, including EU Regulation 2021/821 (Dual-Use Regulation).

The Licensor reserves the right to verify the Licensee's identity against the
EU consolidated sanctions list before issuing a license.

## 15. How to purchase

Contact via the project repository at
**https://github.com/pljeroen/humeris** or via
**https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroen-visser-253154a9/** with:

- Your company name, registered address, and applicable tier
- Intended use (brief description)
- For Government & Defense tier: nature of the contracting entity

You will receive an invoice and a signed license agreement. Payment via bank
transfer. License is effective upon payment.

## 16. Relationship to this document

This document describes the commercial licensing terms for the covered files.
It is **not** itself a binding agreement. A binding license agreement is
executed separately upon purchase (signed by both parties). Until such agreement
is executed, no commercial use rights are granted beyond the evaluation period
in Section 3.

## 17. Open core files

All files listed in the "MIT-Licensed Files" section of `LICENSE` are MIT-
licensed. They are not subject to this agreement and may be used freely under
the MIT License terms.
